# Result
The Result model holds the methods that Word contains, yet with the aggregation of a new method to add the behavior of converting the instance of that object to JSON for web requests. Result contains the attributes that result from searching for words. The _toJSON()_ method, dumps the entirety of the object down to json serialized representations of themselves.

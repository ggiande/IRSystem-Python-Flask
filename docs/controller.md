# Controller
The Controller holds methods that read, organize data, and call other functions to return organized pieces of data. The controller stores business logic between the model Word and the Kivy Interface. The controller instantiates an instance of the IRSystem to pass as arguments into class methods. The _process_files()_ method, pre-processes a list of files using the IRSystem. The _print_word_contents_ method, takes a word or a set of words from the interface, and returns available data to the user. The controller should get called after UI finishes building to pre-process the data.
